    <h2> Sewing Machine</h2>
  </hgroup>
    <p>As you already know, you will need a sewing machine to sew things! And guys, you don't need a top of the line, expensive machine. A basic machine with a variety of stitches (that actually works) can average $100 or even less. I purchased a $70 machine for home and I've worked with very expensive machines (including industrial). I can tell you the $70 machine does everything I need it to and my projects come out just the same! A lot of the time, problems arise from simple things like the needle or thread you're using.</p>

    <h2> Machine needles</h2>
  </hgroup>
    <p>Machine needles are specifically made for your sewing machine, is essential to allow your machine to actually sew thread through your project! Usually your sewing machine manual will have a diagram of how to put in and take out a needle. There are a variety of needles sizes for different types of fabric and thickness.

    <h2> Bobbins</h2>
  </hgroup>
    <p>These are handy to thread different colors. You may only ever use a handful of colors or evry color of the rainbow eventually, so a few extra can be handy. When you purchase a machine, they usually supply you with a few.</p>

    <h2> Thread</h2>
  </hgroup>
    <p>You need thread to sew your fabric, of course. You wind your bobbins with thread and load the top of the machine with the spool of thread (this is the top and bottom thread). The most-used ones are All-Purpose Thread, cotton or polyester, but there are other kinds for specific fabrics and weights. </p>

    <h2> Pins & Pincushion</h2>
  </hgroup>
    <p>Pins will keep your fabric in place while you cut and sew it. They can be plastic or metal, in different sizes. Choose ones that you would like to use. The pincushion is a handy way to keep all your pins together and the stuff on the inside sharpens the tips! If you want to make sure you don't lose any pins/ needles on the ground, I would recommend buying a magnetic dish, like the pink one you see in the picture.</p>

    <h2> Fabric Scissors</h2>
  </hgroup>
    <p>You use fabric scissors to cut your fabric and thread. They are very sharp but SHOULD NOT BE USED ON ANYTHING OTHER THAN FABIC/THREAD! If you use them on other things, they will start to dull. Please keep far away from children, husbands, and carpenters!</p>

    <h2> Tape Measure</h2>
  </hgroup>
    <p>A tape measure, with inches and/or centimeters is used to take measurements on yourself and anything else you might need them to measure. This is very handy.</p>

    <h2> Seam Ripper</h2>

    <p>This thing is a lifesaver and (I think) this is essentail! It cuts seams, opens buttonholes, and cleans up your other mistakes. This will become your best friend, trust me.</p>

    <h2> Marking Tools</h2>
  </hgroup>
    <p>Marking tools transfers markings from patterns and measurements onto your fabric. There are many types you can use, chalk (tailor's chalk or regular chalk), fabric pens, regular pencils, even sharpies. Just be sure that whatever you use is light enough to wash off your specified fabric or the markings won't be visible on the final product.</p>

    <h2> Iron</h2>
  </hgroup>
    <p>Technically, you can still sew if you don't have an iron, but it can make the difference between a homemade-looking garment and a profession-looking one. This helps to press seams and smooth out fabric, out of a list of many uses. Any iron will do, but a steaming feature is also helpful to have. I bought an iron with a steamer for around $20 and it works great.</p>
