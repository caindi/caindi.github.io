 <div class="container-fluid"> 
  <div class="row">

   <div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
    <img class="img-responsive" src="resources/1s.png" alt="An image of my fabric folded over twice, with two pink arrows on both edges.">
</div>


<div class=" col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 col-xs-12">
<p class="circleskirt_text"> Things you will need: </br> At least one yard of fabric, scissors, a tracing utensil, and measuring tape! </br> </br> This method is great for non-stretchy fabric and doesn't need a zipper!</br></br>

The three measurements you'll need are your waist and hip measurements and how long you want your skirt to be. You can start by folding your fabric in half length-wise and then again in the other direction (direction of the width). And, please note I'm using 5/8" for all of my seam allowances for this project. This is a commonly used seam allowance used for many different types of garments.</p> </div>

 <div class="col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-1 col-xs-12">
    <img class="img-responsive" src="resources/3s.png" alt="A photo of my fabric marked at the seam allowance, waist line, and bottom of the skirt.">
</div>

<div class=" col-sm-6 col-xs-12 ">
<p class="circleskirt_text cs_textalteration"> Take your waist measurement plus ease ( I usually add one inch for this) and divide everything by 6.28. The resulting number will be the number you use to mark the inner circle (as shown in the photo). To do this, you measure from the point (edge) of the fabric down. Also, make a similar marking 5/8" above your waist measurement. This will be your seam allowance line. Then, mark the last curve from your waist measurement + 5/8" for seam allowance. </p> </div>


<div class=" col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-2 col-xs-12 ">
<p class="circleskirt_text cs_textalteration"> Now cut the seam allowance curve at the top and cut the curve at the waist. I usually pin the bottom, along the curve, to make sure my fabric doesn't move. I am using cotton for this skirt, so the fabric isn't really slippery, but pinning is always a good habit to get into! </p> </div>


 <div class="col-sm-4 col-xs-12">
    <img class="img-responsive" src="resources/2s.png" alt="A photo of my skirt pinned at the bottom and now cut out at the seam allowance and skirt edge lines.">
</div>

<div class="col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-4 col-xs-12">
    <img class="img-responsive" src="resources/5s.png" alt="A photo pf an outline of the wasitband I intend to cut out." >
</div>
<div class=" col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3 col-xs-12 ">
<p class="circleskirt_text"> Next, you're going to cut out the waistband. To find the width, you need to know how wide your elastic is. (Your elastic needs to fit in the final waistband.) You will use the formula: the desired width of your waistband and times this by two. Take that result and add the seam allowance, which you should times by two as well. My elastic is 3/4" wide, so I decided that I wanted my waistband to 1 inch wide. </p> </div>

<div class="col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-1  col-xs-12">
    <img class="img-responsive" src="resources/6s.png" alt="A photo of my waistband being sewn, right sides together, at the seam allowance lines." >
    <p class="circleskirt_text"> Now that you have your two pieces cut out, you want to mark the edges of your waistband with the seam allowance and sew them together. You can sew with a sewing machine or by hand! And, "right" side of your fabric (the side that will show) should be on the inside.</p>
</div>

<div class="col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-2 col-xs-12">
    <img class="img-responsive" src="resources/7s.png" alt="A photo of me showing the gap in my waistband." >
    <p class="circleskirt_text"> As you sew, leave an opening, so you can come back later and add your elastic. It will slide into this opening once everything is in place. My gap is about an inch in length. We will sew this closed at the end.</p>
</div>

<div class="col-sm-4 col-xs-12">
    <img class="img-responsive" src="resources/8s.png" alt="A photo of my waistband folded over one-fourth of an inch.">
    <p class="circleskirt_text"> Now you want to take one edge of your waistband and fold it over 1/4". You can measure across as you fold. I ironed the fold to keep it in place and to make sure it's an equal distance all the way around.</p>
</div>

<div class="col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-1 col-xs-12">
    <img class="img-responsive" src="resources/9s.png" alt="A photo of the seam allowance of my skirt clipped at every inch or so." >
    <p class="circleskirt_text"> Take your skirt and sew on the seam allowance line. (5/8" away from the edge.) This makes it easy to match things up later! After you sew this, take your scissors and snip all the way around your fabric, about every one inch or so. be careful not to snip into your thread. You want to snip curved edges to make the fabric lay flatter, which will be easier to sew to other things without creating things like ripples or folds.</p>
</div>

<div class="col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-1 col-xs-12">
    <img class="img-responsive" src="resources/10s.png" alt="A photo of my waistband and skirt sewn together and the seam allowance trimmed down." >
    <p class="circleskirt_text"> Now comes the fun part! </br> Take the edge of your waistband and the edge of your skirt and mark both at 4 equal distances apart from each other. I like to fold things in half and place a pin on each side and I do the same thing again, to get four equal parts. Once you do this, match up the pins on your skirt and waistband and pin all the way around. (You may have to ease the fabric to get it as flat as you can but that's okay!) </br> Make sure your fabrics are facing each other RIGHT sides together. You want the right side to be hidden as you sew. Then you can trim the seam allowance. I just trimmed it in half. You can trim more than that. Trimming seam allowances makes it easier to fold over fabrics and makes things look less bulky.</p>
</div>

<div class="col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-1 col-xs-12">
    <img class="img-responsive" src="resources/11s.png" alt="A photo of my skirt being ironed.">
    <p class="circleskirt_text"> At this point I decided to iron my skirt. You don't have to, but it's a good habit to iron your garmets as you're creating them to give a professional finish and to make things easier for you as you sew! Please note what type of fabric you're working with and adjust your iron accourdingly. Don't want to burn your fabric. </p>
</div>

<div class="col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-1 col-xs-12">
    <img class="img-responsive" src="resources/12s.png" alt="A photo of my waistband folded over and pinned to the inside of my skirt.">
    <p class="circleskirt_text">  Now that the skirt and waistband are attached, fold the waistband over a quarter inch past the line you sewed for your skirt. There's only one sewn line, so you can't miss it. </br></br> Pin all the way around. </p>
</div>

<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-4 col-xs-12">
    <img class="img-responsive" src="resources/13s.png" alt="A photo of my waistband being sewn with my sewing machine, with pins in the background.">
    <p class="circleskirt_text"> Sew as close as you can to the edge of the fabric (you can use the "stitch in a ditch" method for this or just a regular straight stitch.) There should still be that opening in your waistband from earlier. And, PLEASE don't sew over your pins guys. Not only is it a bad habit, but you don't want your needle to break off and hit you in the eye or something. Please, just don't do it! </p>
</div>

<div class=" col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-1 col-xs-12">
<p class="circleskirt_text cs_textalteration"> You're almost done! Now cut a piece of elastic, using your waist measurement. Then, use something like a safety pin to wind the elastic through your waistband. Don't do what I did and not pin the other side. I pulled the elastic too hard at one point and the other side dissappeared. It took a few minutes to try to coax it back out. You can pin the other side. </br></br>Then pull both ends and sew them together. Make sure the elastic isn't twisted beforehand. Then just handstitch that opening closed in your waistband.</p> </div>

    <img class="img-responsive" src="resources/finalskirt.png" alt="A finsihed image of my skirt with the caption, You've just created a skirt! Yay!">
    <p class="circleskirt_text"> And viola! You have a new skirt you can add to your wardrobe! </br> I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and keep on making!
